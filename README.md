*npScarf*: Scaffolding and Completing Assemlies in Real-time Fashion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*npScarf* (jsa.np.gapcloser) is a program that scaffolds and completes draft genomes assemblies 
in real-time with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. The pipeline can run on a computing cluster
as well as on a laptop computer for microbial datasets. It can facilitate the real-time 
analysis of positional information such as gene ordering and the detection of genes from
mobile elements (plasmids and genomic islands).

Installation
============
Quick installation guide::

    git clone https://github.com/mdcao/japsa
    cd japsa
    make install \
      [INSTALL_DIR=~/.usr/local \] 
      [MXMEM=7000m \] 
      [SERVER=true \] 
      [JLP=/usr/lib/jni:/usr/lib/R/site-library/rJava/jri]

*npScarf* module is bundled within the [Japsa package](http://mdcao.github.io/japsa/).
Details of installation (including for Windows) and usage of Japsa can be found 
in its documentation hosted on [ReadTheDocs](http://japsa.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) 
In order to run the pipeline in real-time, [npReader]( https://github.com/mdcao/npReader) is required.
Make sure it is installed and configured properly.


Usage
=====
A summary of *npScarf* usage can be obtained by invoking the --help option::

   	jsa.np.gapcloser --help
Input
------
*npScarf* takes two files as required input::

	jsa.np.gapcloser -s <*draft*> -b <*bam*>
	
<*draft*> input is the FASTA file containing the pre-assemblies. Normally this 
is the output from running SPAdes on Illumina MiSeq paired end reads.

<*bam*> contains SAM/BAM formated alignments between <*draft*> file and <*nanopore*> 
FASTA/FASTQ file of long read data. We use BWA-MEM as the recommended aligner 
with the fixed parameter set as follow::

	bwa mem -k11 -W20 -r10 -A1 -B1 -O1 -E1 -L0 -a -Y <*draft*> <*nanopore*> > <*bam*>
	
Output
------
*npScarf* output is specified by *-prefix* option. The default prefix is \'out\'.
Normally the tool generate two files: *prefix*.fin.fasta and *prefix*.fin.japsa which 
indicate the result scaffolders in FASTA and JAPSA format.

In realtime mode, if any annotation analysis is enabled, a file named 
*prefix*.anno.japsa is generated instead. This file contains features detected after
scaffolding.

Real-time scaffolding
----------------------
To run *npScarf* in streaming mode::

   	jsa.np.gapcloser -realtime [options]

In this mode, the <*bam*> file will be processed block by block. The size of block 
(number of BAM/SAM records) can be manipulated through option *-read* and *-time*.

The idea of streaming mode is when the input <*nanopore*> file is retrieved in stream.
npReader is the module that provides such data from fast5 files returned from the real-time
base-calling cloud service Metrichor. Ones can run::

	jsa.np.f5reader -realtime -folder c:\Downloads\ -fail -output - | \

	bwa mem -t 10 -k11 -W20 -r10 -A1 -B1 -O1 -E1 -L0 -a -Y -K 3000 <*draft*> - 2> /dev/null | \ 

	jsa.np.gapcloser --realtime -b - -seq <*draft*> > log.out 2>&1

or if you have the whole set of Nanopore long reads already and want to emulate the 
streaming mode::

	jsa.np.timeEmulate -s 100 -i <*nanopore*> -output - | \

	bwa mem -t 10 -k11 -W20 -r10 -A1 -B1 -O1 -E1 -L0 -a -Y -K 3000 <*draft*> - 2> /dev/null | \ 

	jsa.np.gapcloser --realtime -b - -seq <*draft*> > log.out 2>&1

Note that jsa.np.timeEmulate based on the field *timeStamp* located in the read name line to
decide the order of streaming data. So if your input <*nanopore*> already contains the field,
you have to sort it::

	jsa.seq.sort -i <*nanopore*> -o <*nanopore-sorted*> -sortKey=timeStamp

or if your file does not have the *timeStamp* data yet, you can manually make ones. For example::

	cat <*nanopore*> |awk 'BEGIN{time=0.0}NR%4==1{printf "%s timeStamp=%.2f\n", $0, time; time++}NR%4!=1{print}' \
	> <*nanopore-with-time*> 

Real-time annotation
--------------------
The tool includes usecase for streaming annotation. Ones can provides database of antibiotic
resistance genes and/or Origin of Replication in FASTA format for the analysis of gene ordering
and/or plasmid identifying respectively::

	jsa.np.timeEmulate -s 100 -i <*nanopore*> -output - | \

	bwa mem -t 10 -k11 -W20 -r10 -A1 -B1 -O1 -E1 -L0 -a -Y -K 3000 <*draft*> - 2> /dev/null | \ 

	jsa.np.gapcloser --realtime -b - -seq <*draft*> -resistGene <*resistDB.fasta*> -oriRep <*origDB.fasta*> > log.out 2>&1

Or one can input any annotation in GFF 3.0 format:

	jsa.np.gapcloser --realtime -b - -seq <*draft*> -genes <*genesList.GFF*> > log.out 2>&1
